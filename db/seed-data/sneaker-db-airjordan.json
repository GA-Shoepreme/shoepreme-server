The black finish of the suede and mesh upper is contrasted by a silver reflective tongue that recalls the Air Jordan 5, complete with a Jumpman icon in Fire Red. Additional flecks of crimson land on the Flightwire cables that reinforce the sneaker’s side panels. A color-fade effect in black and red is applied to the Eclipse Plate, with the latter hue seeping into the herringbone rubber outsole.",

The Union LA x Air Jordan 1 Retro High NRG &#39;Storm Blue&#39; Sample features a distressed leather upper with exposed stitch detailing and suede on the collar. Below, an Off-White midsole purposely simulates age for a worn in look and feel.",

Bronze accents appear on the contrasting details, like the branding, collar and outsole, while the Nike Air logo on the tongue is replaced with a Jumpman icon that’s applied with a Velcro patch. The Wings logo is replaced with AIR JORDAN on the side, this shoe was inspired by an early prototype sample seen in a photo shoot from Jordan’s rookie year.",

Not wanting to scrap the unexpected colorway, Nike repurposed it as the ‘Black Bottom’ and released it a year later on Nike.com. Whether a true story or not, both ‘Photo Blue’ AJ9s pair a black upper with blue accents, but only this one boasts a black bottom.",
