The sneaker wears a white leather upper with mismatched Swooshes drawn from the likes of the ‘Neon’ Air Max 95 and ‘Dusty Cactus’ Air Max 93. Molded eyelets are taken from the 90, toe box embroidery references the ‘98, and a gradient grey mudguard offers a further nod to the 95. ‘3.26,’ aka Air Max Day, is debossed on the left heel, while the insole’s timeline graphic depicts the various silhouettes that make up the shoe’s hybrid composition.",
