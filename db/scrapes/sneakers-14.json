A stealthy monochromatic finish is executed on the all-leather upper, secured with an updated ankle strap and zippered detailing that wraps around the heel and extends down the lateral midfoot. The high-top is mounted on a matching black rubber cupsole modeled after the original Forum, complete with a medial-side EVA wedge covered in Dillinger webbing.",
