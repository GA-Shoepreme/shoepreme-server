The all-leather upper combines a navy blue base with contrasting overlays in Wolf Grey. An unexpected pop of color arrives via Nike branding in University Red on the heel tab and woven tongue tag, while satin laces and a matching collar lining add to the shoe’s luxe look. A translucent rubber outsole offers grippy traction underfoot.",

The sneaker wears a white leather upper with mismatched Swooshes drawn from the likes of the ‘Neon’ Air Max 95 and ‘Dusty Cactus’ Air Max 93. Molded eyelets are taken from the 90, toe box embroidery references the ‘98, and a gradient grey mudguard offers a further nod to the 95. ‘3.26,’ aka Air Max Day, is debossed on the left heel, while the insole’s timeline graphic depicts the various silhouettes that make up the shoe’s hybrid composition.",
