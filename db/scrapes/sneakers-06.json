      "story": "Replicating the look of an unreleased sample pair that surfaced in 2010, the Nike LeBron 8 ‘HWC’ dresses the retro silhouette in a color scheme inspired by the Cleveland Cavaliers’ throwback jerseys from the late ‘80s. A vibrant royal blue finish is applied to the upper, constructed from a blend of suede and TPU. Contrasting orange accents land on the laces and tongue, embellished with a 3D graphic of LeBron James’ lion logo. The citrus hue is repeated on sneaker’s full-length Max Air unit and rubber outsole.",
