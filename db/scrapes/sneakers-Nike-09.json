Contrasting black overlays at the toe and heel are good for lightweight support, while blue semi-translucent taping wraps under the forefoot for added containment. The low-top is mounted on a clear midsole, featuring a large-volume Max Air unit that extends from heel to arch. A matching translucent rubber outsole delivers grippy traction on the hardwood.",
