In lieu of traditional laces, the bright yellow inflatable cage of the 1994 Instapump Fury secures the upper of the black leather oxford. A split toe design recalls the French luxury house’s iconic Tabi boot from 1988. The slip-on’s exaggerated tooling, enhanced with Reebok’s Hexalite cushioning technology, takes inspiration from the Margiela Retro Fit sneaker, complete with a serrated tread under the heel.",
