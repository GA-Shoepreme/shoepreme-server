The V2 is more aerodynamic in appearance, with sleek, reflective overlays that draw the eye in. This rendition, the Yeezy Boost 700 V2 &#39;Tephra&#39; sneaker, features a mesh and suede upper with subdued natural tones, culminating in deeper hues on the midsole. This version reprises the 700&#39;s chunky sole, concealing full-length adidas Boost cushioning, underscored by gum-rubber tread.",
