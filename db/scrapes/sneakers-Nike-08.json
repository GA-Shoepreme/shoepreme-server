Breathable white textile is utilized on the upper, secured with an integrated lacing system for a locked-in fit. The sneaker’s cushioning technology is carried over from the PG 4, featuring a full-length Nike Air Dot Weld Strobel stitched directly to the upper. Underfoot, the rubber outsole uses a multidirectional tread for grippy stop-and-go traction.",
