Responsive cushioning arrives via a Boost midsole, painted black and reinforced with a herringbone rubber outsole.",

A layered RPU cage with cooling air channels bolsters the Primeknit upper, partially made with recycled materials and featuring UV reactive technology, which yields different colors when exposed to sunlight. The sneaker rides on a full-length Boost midsole, supported underfoot by a tri-tone Continental rubber outsole.",
