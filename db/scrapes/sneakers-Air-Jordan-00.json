      "story": "Made for grade schoolers, the Air Jordan 35 GS ‘Bred’ dresses the performance hoops shoe in a color scheme baked into the DNA of the Jordan franchise. The black finish of the suede and mesh upper is contrasted by a silver reflective tongue that recalls the Air Jordan 5, complete with a Jumpman icon in Fire Red. Additional flecks of crimson land on the Flightwire cables that reinforce the sneaker’s side panels. A color-fade effect in black and red is applied to the Eclipse Plate, with the latter hue seeping into the herringbone rubber outsole.",

The bright assemblage of colors up top is offset by a white foam sole unit, equipped with flex grooves that allow little feet to move freely and comfortably.",
